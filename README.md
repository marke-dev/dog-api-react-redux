# React Interview test

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) using the [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/).

This project uses React, React Router, Redux, Axios, and Styled Components.

The Home Page (The Breeds Page) is already implemented. The individual breed page and sub breed pages have not been implemented.

The dog service api file has all the api calls needed.

# Requirements

* Implement search functionality on all breeds page
* Implement search functionality on individual breeds page if and only if the breed has sub breeds
* Show all breed images on individual breed pages
* Show all sub breed images on individual sub breed pages
* Use Redux to store all images

# During Interview

Be able to explain how the entire project functions
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
